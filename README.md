## Welcome to my Weather-forecast!


## I would like to start with a list of things I learned on this project.
<ul>
    <li>I learned how to fetch and return data from third party API's</li> 
    <li>I leanred how to traverse the returned data to extract desired information</li>
    <li>I learned how to store data within dynamically created html for recalling later</li>
    <li>I learned how to extract img icons and update them dynamically</li>
    
</ul>

## Functions of my App
<ul>
    <li>On load this app will present you with three text feilds and two buttons</li>
    <li>When you input a city, state and country then click either Todays Weather or Five Day Forecast</li>
    <li>Then you will be presented with a single card or multiple cards containing the weather information</li>
    <li>That search is then stored in local data and a new button on the corresponding side of the page will be generated.</li>
    <li>When you click on the new button it will recall your previous search</li>
    <li>On page reload or refresh, local storage will be recalled into the buttons generated from searches</li>
</ul>

## Future improvements/updates
<ul>
    <li>I was unable to have the localstorage store state and country data without breaking, so the recalled data just makes those feilds blank on recall searches</li>
    <li>I would like to make this app function on cellphone clicks, the eventlisteners dont seem to be responsive on cellphones.</li>
</ul>
